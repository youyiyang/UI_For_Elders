# UI For Elders
 This repository is try to discuss how to build better sofware user interfaces for the old people since they are hard to familiarize nowadays software operations.
 Today, with the great development of computer technologies, more and more people spend their time by using computers or devices connected with computer technologies, such as iphones, ipads, andriod mobile phones etc.
 However, I find these devices are not easy to use for old people. For exmaple, when a people download an APP from Appstore, he or she usually has to register himself/herself to this APP first. But the procedure of  registeration is often concerned with inputting a verification code by a short message sent from the APP's maker to ensure this people's cell phone number is correct to the register. Well, this is quite difficult for the old people to understand and much harder for them to switch between the short message window and the APP window to operate this registeration.
 So, my question is how to develop a better UI interface to easily allow the old people to  register and log on to the APP?
 Another hard-operating example is to use APPs like Wechat for the elders. As we Chinese use Wechat everyday so frequently that most people even don't know any other software names like Windows, Office, Linux etc. So most old people living in China only use Webchat everyday. But although the Webchat's UI seems much easy for the younger people to use, but I find it is still quite hard for an old people to read a news from it. This may be the font size is too small for him/her to read. But the olde one usually can't change the font size without others' help. So how to improve this situation?
 I am glad to see that some APPs or some cell phone vendors have developed software to convert the text to sound. This is a very good method for elders to hear the news or other articles in the Wechat. So I think I  can conclude this method to a better user interface for elders called "sound technology".
 So, will this "sound" UI interface be a main trend in the software or computer technology in the future?
 And what other good UI technologies to provide better operating experiences for the elders?
 What I am now thinking is AR technology. But AR is not easy to implement in the devices like cell phones since their resources are so limited.
 I am welcome friends like you to join this discussion. Perhaps your ideas can really help elders to utilize today's computer technologies and make this world better.

 You can see the thinnest TV screen produced by China with the "sound" UI that help people to better control it.
